### Discovery Call Script

**Opening:**
"Thanks for your time, [Name]. I want to understand what computing challenges you're facing and see if our R&D lab can help. What projects are you currently working on that need serious computing power?"

**Qualifying Questions:**
1. "What kind of simulations/analysis are you running?"
2. "What infrastructure are you currently using?"
3. "How long does it typically take to get results?"
4. "What's your biggest bottleneck - time, expertise, or hardware?"
5. "What would it be worth to get results 10x faster?"

**Demo:**
"Let me show you how this works. You tell us what you want to compute - could be quantum simulation, AI model training, complex analysis, whatever. We run it on our magic machine and deliver the results. No setup, no infrastructure, no PhDs required."

**Pricing Presentation:**
"We keep it simple:
- **$299** gets you 2-4 hours - perfect for proof of concepts
- **$1,000** gets you 24 hours - serious R&D work
- **$5,000** gets you a full week - major projects

Most customers start with the $299 package to test it out, then upgrade to weekly access once they see the results."

**Objection Handling:**

*"That seems expensive"*
→ "Compared to what? A single GPU server costs $10K+, plus months of setup. We give you access TODAY for $299. Plus, if we don't deliver results, you get 100% money back."

*"We have our own infrastructure"*
→ "Great! How long would it take you to run [their project] on your current setup? We can probably do it 10x faster. Think of us as overflow capacity for your toughest problems."

*"We don't have quantum expertise"*
→ "That's exactly why we exist. You tell us WHAT you want to compute. We handle HOW. No quantum physics degree required."

*"We need to evaluate multiple vendors"*
→ "No problem. Here's what makes us different: Simple pricing, instant access, 100% guarantee. Want to test us head-to-head? First session is 50% off."

**Closing:**
"Based on what you've told me, I'd recommend starting with the [package]. That gives you [duration] to [solve their problem]. We can have you up and running within 24 hours. Should I send over the contract?"
